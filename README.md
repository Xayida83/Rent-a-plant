Company Website Project
Project Overview
This project, completed as part of a course on HTML, CSS, and Accessibility, entailed the creation of a website for a fictional company. 
The company's mission was to sell a product or service of our choosing. Our goal was to design a responsive and accessible website that not only showcases the company's offerings 
but also provides information about the company's history, its employees, customer reviews, and contact details.

Project Tasks
Design and Planning
We started by creating wireframes and/or mockups using our preferred design tools.

To guide our work, we began by establishing a company profile, including:
Graphic Profile
Selected 3-6 consistent color codes for the entire website. While additional colors were allowed, these should be the primary ones.
Chose 2 (or more) fonts, with one for headings and another for body text.
Created a company name (and even designed our own logo).

Website Structure
The website consists of five main sections:
Home
Provides a clear introduction to the company and its products or services.
Includes a Call-to-Action (CTA) that directs users to the product page.

About Us
Offers a historical overview of the company.
Features a company motto/catchphrase.
Profiles the company's employees, each with a photo, job role, company email, and a brief description (minimum 6 employees).

Products/Services
Displays detailed information about the products or services offered.
Can offer multiple products or services or variations with different price points (e.g., product/service, price, etc.).
Includes buttons to purchase/order products/services (actual functionality is not required).

References
Contains customer reviews of products or services, including short comments and optional ratings.
Reviews can be written by businesses and/or individuals, depending on the company's offerings.

Features a contact form for users to submit:

An individual report should be submitted, addressing the following questions:

How well did you adhere to your wireframe/mockup? If you deviated, please explain the reasons.
What were the biggest challenges in this project?
What have you learned during the project?

Grading Criteria

All requirements as mentioned above are met.
The website functions properly on a standard desktop.
